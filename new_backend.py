User: How can I reduce belly fat?

Coach:
Reducing belly fat comes down to a few simple habits. Focus on eating more protein-rich foods like eggs, fish, chicken, or lentils, because protein helps control hunger and supports muscle.

Combine that with regular activity like brisk walking, running, or strength training for about 30–40 minutes a day.

Also try to reduce sugary drinks and highly processed foods. Small consistent habits make the 
biggest difference."""
